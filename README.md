# Data-Analysis-with-R

The report explores a dataset containing wine quality and attributes for approximately 1599 red wines. 

All the chemical properties of the wine are explored for the first round. 
After that, I chose some interesting results for further investigation.
I created ggpairs for correlation in both numerical form and graphs. 

I then created three unique plots that illustrate how alcohol percentage is essential to the quality of red wine.

Based on the analysis I did for the dataset, I am convinced that alcohol concentrate is the most important factor to deciding the quality of Red Wine would be density. The lower the density, the higher the alcohol concentration, and the higher the alcohol concentration the better the quality of wine.
